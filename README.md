### About ipSlav ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Petar Jr. Pranic** and I am a red team guy currently working as a Red Team Manager in [Shielder](https://www.shielder.com/) leading a small team dedicated to Offensive Operations activities.
Throughout my experience in the offensive security field, **I have participated in and managed more than 100 engagements** targeting mid and large enterprises spanning several industries.

Outside my day to day job responsibilities **my primary interest lies in analyzing and detecting adversary tradecrafts and techniques**, with a focus on Microsoft products, while understading how things work internally, trying to make a sense on what is happening under the hood of our digital world.
